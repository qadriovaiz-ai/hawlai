# Architectural Decisions — P0 Audit

Section 32b: judgment calls made during this audit that weren't explicitly asked about, logged here for review rather than left buried in commit messages — plus a forward-looking checklist for when future pieces should pause and ask vs. proceed.

## Retrospective log — decisions made without an explicit ask

**10b — gated activation only, not launch.** `/api/ads/adlaunch` (creates a campaign) and `/api/ads/[id]/status` (flips it ACTIVE/PAUSED) both had zero role gating. Reading the actual code showed launch always creates the campaign `PAUSED` — no money moves until a separate activation call. Scoped the fix to activation only, and reclassified `ad_campaign_launch` in `executionPolicy.ts` from critical/spend down to medium/create to match. *Worth checking:* do you want launch itself gated too (e.g. to stop a low-authority team member from generating campaign drafts freely), or is "anyone can draft, only authority can spend" the right split?

**10b — `daily_budget` as the approval-threshold amount.** `checkApprovalAuthority` needs a ₹ figure to compare against `approval_threshold`. Used the campaign's `daily_budget` (a recurring number) rather than, say, a projected total spend over some window. *Worth checking:* a ₹500/day campaign and a ₹500 one-time spend read as the same "amount" today, but one recurs indefinitely.

**11a — two separate Master Chat tools instead of one parameterized tool.** `propose_campaign_budget_change` / `propose_campaign_targeting_change` rather than one `edit_campaign(kind, ...)` tool. Matches the existing codebase style (many small explicit tools) and lets Claude's own tool-selection do the classification instead of a second parsing step — but it's more surface area to maintain if a third edit type shows up later.

**11a — service-role client for a Master Chat insert.** Master Chat runs on the caller's own RLS-scoped session client, but `pending_approvals` is owner-only RLS — so a non-owner team member's proposal would silently fail to insert. Used `createServiceClient()` for just that insert, after `dealershipId` was already resolved server-side from the caller's own session — same pattern the approvals executor itself already uses on this table. Not a new precedent, but it is the first time Master Chat's own tool-execution layer reaches for the service client for a *write* (existing uses were storage uploads).

**11b — blocked activation auto-creates a request instead of just failing.** The literal ask (10b) was "gate this." Turning a 403 into an actual queued `pending_approvals` row was an interpretation of what "gate" should feel like for the requester, not a literal requirement. *Worth checking:* is silently queuing the right default, or should the requester be asked before their attempt becomes a standing request someone else has to act on?

**11b — one pending activation request per campaign at a time.** Clicking "Activate" repeatedly while a request is outstanding doesn't create duplicates — it just re-confirms the existing one is queued. Chose this over allowing multiple stacked requests; nothing in the spec said which was wanted.

**11c — modify-support scoped to `change_campaign_budget` only.** "MODIFY" wasn't defined precisely. Targeting changes are multi-field and interpretive (not a single number to edit); activation is binary. Scoped to the one action type where "let the approver pick a different number" is unambiguous. Targeting/activation modification would need real design work if wanted later.

**11c — re-authorize against the modified amount, not the original.** If an approver raises the requested budget while approving, the code re-runs `checkApprovalAuthority` against the *new* number before applying — otherwise someone could get an unauthorized higher spend past their own ceiling by "modifying" a lower request upward. This is a security-relevant call I made without flagging it at the time; logging it here for visibility.

**11d — renamed existing registry keys instead of leaving the drift.** `executionPolicy.ts`'s `ACTION_POLICIES` keys (`ad_campaign_activate`, `campaign_auto_pause`) didn't match the real `action_type` strings in use (`activate_ad_campaign`, `auto_paused_campaign`) — the registry was dead code, so nothing broke, but I renamed the keys rather than adding aliases or leaving a mapping layer. If anything external ever referenced the old key names directly (nothing does today, verified), this would be a breaking rename.

**12c — wrapped all 13 cron subsystems uniformly, not just the 10 that lacked logging.** The ask was really about the 10 blind subsystems; the other 3 already had their own logs. Wrapped all 13 in `runAndLog` for one consistent observability surface rather than a partial one. Flagged inline in that turn's summary at the time.

**32a — summary table over full column dump.** `docs/DATABASE.md` documents 87 tables at "purpose + which migration to check" granularity, not full DDL. Chosen because a full dump would duplicate the migrations (the real source of truth) and go stale immediately. If the intent was closer to a complete standalone schema reference, this undershoots that.

## Forward-looking checklist — pause and ask vs. proceed

**Proceed without asking when:**
- An established precedent for the exact same kind of problem already exists elsewhere in the codebase — reuse it, note that you did, move on (e.g. the service-client-after-server-resolved-dealershipId pattern, reused four times now: approvals executor, 11a, 11b, campaigns page).
- The decision is reversible and low-blast-radius (doc structure/scope, internal naming, which of two similarly-clean code shapes to use).
- The literal ask plus Section 37's standing rules (reuse architecture, never weaken RLS, no client-side-only enforcement for sensitive actions) fully determine the answer — there's only one architecturally sound choice.

**Pause and ask when:**
- The codebase reveals two or more genuinely different valid designs and picking one has security or data-correctness implications (who can do what, what counts as "the amount" for a threshold check).
- The spec's own wording is ambiguous enough that two reasonable readings would produce different scopes (this is exactly what happened with 32b itself).
- Implementing requires changing or renaming something already shipped that other code — or a person — might already depend on, even if nothing currently references it.
- The right UX/behavior isn't specified by the literal ask and genuinely could go either way with no clearly-better default (11b's "auto-queue on block" call).

**Always, even when proceeding without asking:**
- Say what was decided and why, in the commit message and the turn's status update — not just in code comments. A judgment call that's only visible by reading a diff line-by-line isn't actually disclosed.
