# Grading sheet — reviewer

Score **every** sentence.

- **T** — true, and the records support it
- **F** — false, or the records do not support it
- **U** — cannot tell from the records (this is a real answer, not a cop-out)
- **—** — not a claim at all: a feeling, a greeting, a question, a call to action

**Do not trust the `kind` column.** It is this codebase's own classifier
guessing, and it is English-biased. In the baseline run of 13 October 2026
it called "yeh slower aur cleaner jalte hain regular paraffin wax ke
mukable" a *feeling*. That is a comparison with a competitor's product —
the worst sentence in the whole run — and the first version of this sheet
told you to leave it blank. Read the sentence, not the label.

**SCOPE RULE (founder, 16 October 2026).** A sentence that makes a
claim about ONE named product or service needs a record about THAT
product or service. A general fact about how the business works does
not support it, however true that general fact is — so a sentence in
the shape *general business fact → specific product claim* is **U or
F, never T**. "We do not use ammonia-based products" is the
business's practice; "this treatment contains no ammonia" is a claim
about one item, and only a record about that item supports it.

Do not look at the other grader's sheet until yours is finished.
